      <item value="That outputs this CSS:" />
      <item value="Here's an example:" />
      <item value="This will then generate different paddings at different breakpoints. Alternatively supply a numeric value (without a unit type) to output a static rem value." />
      <item value="The padding value can be set to `$grid-column-gutter` to use the values from that map." />
      <item value="An optional padding value" />
      <item value="The child element selector" />
      <item value="Number of columns" />
      <item value="By default the mixin takes 3 parameters:" />
      <item value="Use the `grid-layout()` mixin to create your own block grid." />
      <item value="Custom Block Grid" />
      <item value="Refer to the Sass documentation below to learn how each mixin works." />
      <item value="Every other grid feature, from sizing to offsets to source ordering, can also be accessed with a mixin. Pair them with the `breakpoint()` mixin to make your grid responsive." />
      <item value="You can also temporarily change the grid context without outputting any row CSS, by using the `grid-context()` mixin." />
      <item value="In this example, the grid is 16 columns instead of the normal 12. Any references to column math inside the mixin will use the new column count." />
      <item value="By default, all grids use the number of columns set by the `$grid-column-count` variable. However, this can be selectively overridden within an instance of a row." />
      <item value="Multiple Grids" />
      <item value="To center a column semantically. Use ´grid-column-position(center);´." />
      <item value="The grid column calculator can also be accessed as a function. This gives you the percentage value, without any of the grid column CSS." />
      <item value="Use the `grid-column()` mixin to create a column. There are a number of ways to define the width of the column." />
      <item value="Use the `grid-row()` mixin to create a row." />
      <item value="Our grid CSS is generated with a powerful set of Sass mixins, which you can use in your own code to build a semantic grid." />
      <item value="Building Semantically" />
      <item value="Watch this part in video" />
      <item value="Block grids are a shorthand way to create equally-sized columns. Add a class of the format `.[size]-up-[n]` to change the number of columns within the row. By default, the max number of columns you can use with block grid are 8. Adding the `.column-block` class to columns will apply a bottom margin equal to the width of gutters." />
      <item value="Using these source ordering classes, you can shift columns around between our breakpoints. This means if you place sub-navigation below main content on small displays, you have the option to position the sub-navigation on either the left or right of the page for large displays. Prefix push/pull with the size of the device you want to apply the styles to. `.medium-push-#`, `.large-push-#` is the syntax you'll use. Use the number 0 instead to reset a push/pull, such as `.medium-push-0` or `.large-pull-0`." />
      <item value="Source Ordering" />
      <item value="Class Applier" />
      <item value="Center your columns by adding a class of `.small-centered` to your column. Large will inherit small centering by default, but you can also center solely on large by applying a `.large-centered` class. To uncenter on large screens, use `.large-uncentered`." />
      <item value="Centered Columns" />
      <item value="Scale the browser down to a medium size to see the difference." />
      <item value="There are times when you won't want each media query to be collapsed or uncollapsed. In this case, use the media query size you want and collapse or uncollapse and add that to your row element. Example shows no gutter at small media size and then adds the gutter to columns at medium." />
      <item value="The `.collapse` class lets you remove column gutters (padding)." />
      <item value="Collapse/Uncollapse Rows" />
      <item value="You can also explicitly set the gutter size for a particular grid row by adding the `.gutter-[size]` class. This is useful when your using responsive gutters but specific components need static gutters." />
      <item value="If you prefer using one gutter size for every breakpoint, just use a single number for the `$grid-column-gutter` variable:" />
      <item value="Static Gutters" />
      <item value="To add more gutter definitions, add new lines to the map. The breakpoint names used here must match a breakpoint name in your project's `$breakpoints` map." />
      <item value="If you're using the Sass version of Foundation, you can change these defaults by editing the `$grid-column-gutter` variable map:" />
      <item value="The grid *gutter*&amp;mdash;the space between two columns in a row, and the space between the edge of a grid and the edge of the page&amp;mdash;is responsive, and becomes wider on larger screens." />
      <item value="In order to work around browsers' different rounding behaviors, Foundation will float the last column in a row to the right so the edge aligns. If your row doesn't have a count that adds up to 12 columns, you can tag the last column with a class of `.end` in order to override that behavior. Alternatively, you can set the `$grid-column-align-edge` variable to `false` to turn off this behavior entirely." />
      <item value="Incomplete Rows" />
      <item value="Move blocks up to 11 columns to the right by using classes like `.large-offset-1` and `.small-offset-3`." />
      <item value="You can nest the grids indefinitely, though at a certain point it will get absurd." />
      <item value="Normally, a row is always 1200 pixels wide. Make a row completely fluid by adding the `.expanded` class." />
      <item value="Column rows can use sizing classes like &lt;code&gt;.small-8&lt;/code&gt;, but only when used as a top-level container&amp;mdash;not when nested inside another row." />
      <item value="If you have just a single column, you can save some markup by combining the `.row` and `.column` classes together on the same element. You can still nest more grids inside this container like usual." />
      <item value="Combined Column/Row" />
      <item value="Medium sized screens will inherit styles from small, unless you specify a different layout using the medium grid classes." />
      <item value="Small grids expand to large screens easier than large grids cram into small screens." />
      <item value="Disabling the alias can reduce the Foundation CSS file size from 3 to 5%. It is recommended if the alias is not used." />
