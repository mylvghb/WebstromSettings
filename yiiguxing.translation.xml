      <item value="# @vue/reactivity ## Usage Note This package is inlined into Global &amp; Browser ESM builds of user-facing renderers (e.g. `@vue/runtime-dom`), but also published as a package that can be used standalone. The standalone build should not be used alongside a pre-bundled build of a user-facing renderer, as they will have different internal storage for reactivity connections. A user-facing renderer should re-export all APIs from this package. For full exposed APIs, see `src/index.ts`. You can also run `yarn build reactivity --types` from repo root, which will generate an API report at `temp/reactivity.api.md`. ## Credits The implementation of this module is inspired by the following prior art in the JavaScript ecosystem: - [Meteor Tracker](https://docs.meteor.com/api/tracker.html)&#10;- [nx-js/reactivity-util](https://github.com/nx-js/reactivity-util)&#10;- [salesforce/observable-membrane](https://github.com/salesforce/observable-membrane) ## Caveats - Built-in objects are not observed except for `Map`, `WeakMap`, `Set` and `WeakSet`." />
